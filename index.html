      <h2>Instructions: </h2>
        <h4><em>Keys</em></h4>
        <ul>
          <li><em>W</em> and <em>S</em> to change lane up and down</li>
          <li><em>A</em> and <em>D</em> to change color within a lane</li>
          <li><em>Enter</em> to place material on conveyor belt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><em>Objective:</em></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Your Job is to prevent the lane workers(white boxes) from reaching the left side of the screen by placing
              material on the lanes to keep the lane workers busy and push them back.</li>
          </ul>
        <h4><em>Rules:</em></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The amount of material you can put down decreases as you put down more and more.
              The Big number is how many of a certain color you will place on that lane.</li>
          <li>These diminishing returns are kept on a per-lane per-color basis.</li>
          <li>After putting down some material you will also see a small number. That number is a countdown to when
              you can put the full amount of material again.</li>
          <li>The Lane workers will get faster and faster at working over time. See what score you can get.</li>
        </ul>
