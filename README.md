A common thing seen in video games is that parts of their mechanics can be seen as modular and a game all in and of themselves.
A real life example of this might be that you are walking down the street while trying to go somewhere (the game as a whole), and
you have to watch your feet and avoid stepping on cracks(mini-game).

#### So I really like World of Warcraft.
And WoW has such a mini-game.
Game balancing also really interest me too
so I tried to distill the basic mechanics of this of this mini-game into a javascript canvas game. so I could turn some knobs and see how they affect the way it plays.

##### The things I was interested in were:
* pacing
* difficulty
* depth

The game can be played [here](/robo-loader). Please note the game might look different now than at the time of this post but the basic mechanics will still be in place.

### Basics:
You are a robot that works in a factory that has a number of horizontal Lanes( 4 in this picture). Inside of each is a "conveyor belt" with a number of cells. The cells move to the right and carry whatever is placed on them.

On the left side of the screen is a "Loading Area" where we can put a certain amount of "material" down on a given Conveyor Belt.

![red 3](images/tutorial/red-3-game.gif)

 Here we just put down 3 red blobs worth of material. The numbers on the left mean that the next time we put down a red material on that lane we will only put down 2 blobs worth of red material.

 Lets look at the next game mechanic...

 ![workers intro](images/tutorial/workers-intro-game.gif)

 The white boxes represent the workers in this factory. The workers will move to the left while they have nothing to work on. If a single worker reaches the loading area the game is over.

By putting down material on a conveyor belt for a lane worker to work on you impede its progress towards the loading area.

You might have noticed that there are 2 sets of numbers on the left. The big number, as I mentioned before, represents how many blobs of material you would place on the given conveyor belt if you were to press enter. The second smaller set of numbers is a counter that counts down till you can place the maximum amount of blobs again.

For instance I see the number 3, and the color green, and I have the fourth lane selected, I press enter and... 3 green blobs are placed on the first lane and then I see 2 and a counters starts counting down from 35 seconds. That means that after 35 seconds have passed the counter reset and I will be able to place 3 green blobs at a time on that lane.

We are now approaching the center of what this game is really about, managing diminishing returns. Something that has a diminishing return means I get a decreased effect from doing the same thing repeatedly. In order to keep the workers from getting to the left side of the screen I need to think about what lanes and color combinations are available to me at a given time.

For instance I might be out of yellow blobs on lane 1 but I have plenty red blobs left on that lane, and I might be out of red blobs on lane 2 but I have plenty of yellow blobs left on that lane. A few seconds later that situation may reverse and I have to keep track of that.

#### One more thing:

Lets say that all conveyor belts have 12 cells on which we can place blobs. If I put a Yellow blob on cell 1 of lane 2 that means that all other lanes's cell 1 are cleared of yellow blobs. If I put a yellow blob on lane 1 and immediately afterwards put a yellow blob on lane 2 the yellow blob on lane 1 will disappear.

When taken together the game is about juggling different colors on different lanes in order to keep the workers from reaching the end.

#### Tweaking it:
I tried to write this in such a way that changing certain aspects of the game would be easy. I did this by creating engines that would update and render the game  generically, regardless of their structure or settings. I then created a default settings file called ```lib/game-settings/board-settings``` that contained everything about the game that could be changed. All of the game component's properties were set by the contents of this file so that if I wanted to change something like
* amount of lanes
* amount of cells to a lane
* how long before diminsing returns reset
* how fast workers moved up the lane
* how long it took for a worker to clear a single blob


#### Lessons learned:

It was surprisingly easy to balance! the hard part was to end
